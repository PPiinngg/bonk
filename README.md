This library contains a bunch of tools that you regularly have to reach for when writing anything that processes audio, such as various filters, delay lines with multiple interpolation options, etc. etc. etc.
It's currently a work-in-progress and is thus subject to drastic change as I have a background in music production and am relatively new to low level programming. As such I wouldn't recommend using this in any serious projects yet.
Contributions would be massively appreciated if you feel so inclined!
